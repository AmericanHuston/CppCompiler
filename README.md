# CppCompiler
Batch files made to compile .cpp files into .exe files. Half a joke but all the files still work. Does not compile without mingw g++. Link to the download and tutorial: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw#_prerequisites DO NOT TAKE THE COPYWRITE SERIOUSLY. IT IS NOT AN ACTUAL COPYWRITE.
